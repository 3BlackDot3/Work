# Building Secure Systems: Real-World IAM Strategy and Integration Experience

## Overview

This repository highlights my hands-on experience during a **Virtual Work Experience: Cybersecurity Analyst Job Simulation** with **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)** via **Forage**. The project focuses on **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** and demonstrates my ability to assess, design, and integrate secure IAM systems across different platforms.

### Key Areas of Focus:
- **IAM Fundamentals**
- **IAM Strategy Assessment**
- **Custom IAM Solution Design**
- **System and Platform Integration**
- **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**

## Project Description

This project simulates real-world tasks of a cybersecurity analyst with an emphasis on **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**. It involves evaluating IAM strategies, crafting custom IAM solutions, integrating these solutions into existing platforms, and assessing security risks.

### Key Components:

1. **IAM Fundamentals**  
   - Developed a foundational understanding of IAM principles and how they are applied to enhance security within organizations.
   - Addressed key topics like authentication, authorization, and access control models.

2. **IAM Strategy Assessment**  
   - Assessed and compared different IAM strategies to identify the most effective approaches for specific organizational needs.
   - Conducted a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of various IAM frameworks (e.g., Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)).

3. **Custom IAM Solution Design**  
   - Designed and implemented custom IAM solutions tailored to unique security requirements.
   - Focused on creating solutions that improve access control and streamline user management while maintaining high security.

4. **System and Platform Integration**  
   - Integrated IAM solutions across multiple platforms, ensuring seamless connectivity and secure data access.
   - Worked with tools and technologies to streamline integration with cloud environments (e.g., AWS, Azure) and on-premise systems.

5. **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**  
   - Evaluated potential security risks associated with IAM implementation and designed strategies to mitigate those risks.
   - Conducted security audits to ensure adherence to best practices.
